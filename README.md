# minitalk

## Overview
`minitalk` is a small data exchange program designed to demonstrate inter-process communication using UNIX signals. The project includes two executables:

- **server**: Receives and displays a string sent by the client.
- **client**: Sends a string as a parameter to the server, identified by its process ID (PID).

The communication utilizes **SIGUSR1** and **SIGUSR2** signals only.

## Features
### Mandatory
- A server that receives a string and displays it.
- A client that sends a string bit-by-bit to the server using UNIX signals.

### Bonus
- Acknowledgement system for successful signal reception.
- Support for Unicode characters.

## Allowed Functions
- `malloc`, `free`, `write`, `getpid`
- `signal`, `sigemptyset`, `sigaddset`, `sigaction`
- `pause`, `kill`, `sleep`, `usleep`
- `exit`

## Compilation
This project is compiled using `make`. Run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
make
```

The `make` command will generate the following executables:
- `server`
- `client`

## How to Run
### Step 1: Start the Server
Run the `server` executable to start the server. The server will display its PID, which will be used by the client to send data:

```bash
./server
```

### Step 2: Run the Client
Using the server's PID, run the `client` executable and pass the PID and the string to be sent as arguments:

```bash
./client <PID> <string>
```

### Example
Start the server:
```bash
$ ./server
Server PID: 12345
```

Run the client with the server's PID:
```bash
$ ./client 12345 "Hello, World!"
```

The server will display:
```bash
Hello, World!
```

├── Makefile       # Compilation rules
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

## Notes
- Ensure the server is running before executing the client.
- The `server` must handle signal interruptions gracefully.
- The `client` should validate inputs, including ensuring the PID is valid and the string is not empty.

This project is part of the 42cursus, designed to deepen understanding of UNIX signals and inter-process communication.
